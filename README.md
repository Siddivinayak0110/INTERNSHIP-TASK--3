# Overview Of Project
### Description

This project implements a Neural Style Transfer system that applies artistic styles to user-uploaded images using a pretrained VGG19 convolutional neural network. It combines the content of a photograph with the style of a painting to generate a stylized output image. The system is deployed as a web application.

 ### Objective

To implement Neural Style Transfer using deep learning.

To extract and combine content and style features from images.

To build a web-based application for real-time user interaction.

### Tools Used

PyTorch

Flask

VGG19 (Pretrained CNN)

Python

HTML

Pillow (PIL)

### Key Features

User image upload from any PC location

Artistic style selection

Content & style loss optimization

Automatic file handling with unique filenames

Web-based interface for viewing styled output
